# Motion prompts (full texts)

Full prompt texts collected by hand from [prompt-motion.com](https://prompt-motion.com/), a gallery curated by @p4nthera_. **The prompts belong to their original creators**, who are credited on each entry's page there; they're reproduced here as reference material for this skill, with credit. If you're a creator and want yours removed or credited differently, open an issue.

Each block matches an id in `motion-library.md`, which summarises what to borrow. The skill reads a block when the storyboard cites its id. These prompts were written for standalone product videos (mostly 16:9). Take their motion ideas and rules, and keep the house format (9:16, layouts, captions, levels) from `brief.md`.

<inputs>
Ask me for anything below I haven't given you. If I skip it, use the default: 3 to 6 screenshots of the real interface (default: capture them yourself), the logo (default: take it from the site), brand colors and font (default: its own colors and typeface), and a royalty-free track with a clear beat (default: compose one in code).
</inputs>

<direction>
A 15-second showreel for Flowdrive. Research it first: what it does, who it's for, its real interface and its brand. Use what you find; never invent screens, features or numbers.
Pick one through-line object from the product itself (its cursor, a key button, the logo's mark, a single data point) and make every scene a transformation of it: it starts in the UI, changes shape or role in each scene, and becomes the logo on the end card. Name it before you storyboard.
Rebuild the real UI as vector layers so its parts can move on their own; never slide a flat screenshot in. A cursor drives every interaction with real clicks and drags, and the camera zooms screen-studio style so each moment fills the frame.
Brand: its own colors and typeface. One typeface, one accent color used only on the through-line object and the key word, lots of empty space.
Motion rules: springs with at most a small overshoot; nothing appears from nothing (it grows, unfolds or is revealed by a mask); the camera never sits still (push from 1.0 to 1.04 across a scene, and start each scene at the zoom the last one ended on); something changes on every beat.
Banned: particle bursts, glows, lens flares, camera shake, RGB split, crossfades, generic gradients, bouncy easing, holds longer than half a second, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM. Write a timed storyboard first, beat by beat, then build exactly that.
Hook (first bar): the problem in three to five words, in big type that the through-line object interrupts.
Middle: three or four moments of the product doing what it does best. Each begins with the through-line object turning into the next UI element and lands one readable idea.
Payoff (last bars): the strongest moment on the biggest beat, then the through-line object becomes the logo and the end card: the name and a one-line call to action.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a kick on every beat and a hit on each scene change. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Measure element positions at runtime for match cuts instead of hard-coding them. When a shape fills the frame, scale it past all four corners. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap. Never put will-change on anything the camera scales, or text renders blurry.
</gotchas>

<start>
Show me what you found, the through-line object and a beat-by-beat storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.
</start>

## gallery-3d-film-camera

- Added: 2026-10-14

```text
<direction>
Build the Prompt Motion gallery, reimagined as a 3D space of video cards on curved walls, as one self-contained HTML page with three.js.
Style: soft daylight and white space in Prompt Motion's own: black and white, Geist, one orange accent.
The signature shot is the pull back where the corridors of cards resolve into the letters PROMPT MOTION seen from above. Build everything toward it.
Camera: a film camera, not orbit controls. Every shot uses one named move (dolly, crane, orbit, push-in, rack focus), eased in and out, and the camera never passes through geometry.
Light and materials: a key, fill and rim light with soft shadows, an environment map for reflections, fog for depth, physically based materials with varied roughness, ACES tone mapping. Nothing should look like a default material.
Motion: things react to each other (what's hit moves, what's near lights up), driven by springs or simple physics, never linear tweens.
Banned: default materials and lighting, floating text labels, glows on everything, a slowly spinning object as the whole idea, anything that looks like a tech demo.
</direction>

<structure>
Shots, about three seconds each:
1. Macro on the edge of one card in soft light, then rack focus onto its playing video (a real poster from the site). 2. Dolly back: it's one of hundreds of cards on a gently curved wall, all playing; a wave of orange light runs along the wall and each card tilts slightly as it passes. 3. Crane up and over the wall: behind it, more walls form corridors. 4. One card unhinges, swings toward the camera with weight and settles; its prompt is printed on its back and lifts off as 3D type, line by line. 5. The signature shot: pull far back and up while the orange light traces the O. 6. Settle on the wordmark and prompt-motion.com.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file, three.js from a CDN, no build step. Model everything in code; no downloaded models, and no textures except the site's own video posters for the cards.
2. Use MeshPhysicalMaterial, a PMREM environment from RoomEnvironment, soft shadows, ACES tone mapping and antialiasing. Add depth of field only on shots that need it.
3. Hold 60fps on a laptop.
4. Add a ?render mode where every frame is computed from time (seeded randomness, no clock), so it can be captured with Playwright into an MP4 at 1920x1080.
5. Capture one frame per shot, look at it, and fix anything flat, aliased, clipping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Set shadow bias, or surfaces get striped acne. Keep near and far planes tight, or distant surfaces flicker. Seed every random number, or the render won't match the preview.
</gotchas>

<start>
Describe the signature shot and the shot list in a few lines, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the HTML file and a 20-second MP4 captured with the ?render mode.
</start>

```text
<direction>
A 15-second motion design showreel that proves you are a world-class motion designer. Concept: your pick (e.g. "ink becomes type becomes architecture"). Commit to it and name it in one line before you start. Every shot is made out of the previous one: shapes, type and color transform into the next scene instead of cutting or fading.
One typeface (Geist, Inter or a bold display face from Google Fonts), a palette of at most three colors plus black and white, one consistent camera language.
Show range: kinetic type, shape morphing, a 2D-to-3D moment, a data or UI moment, and an end title. Give each one an equal share of the time.
Banned: particle bursts, glows, lens flares, camera shake, RGB split, crossfades, generic gradients, bouncy easing, holds longer than half a second, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM, something happens on every beat.
First bar: hook. Then one technique per bar, each flowing out of the last. Last full bar: the strongest moment. Final half bar: end title, and the final frame matches the first so it loops.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a kick on every beat, a riser into the last full bar, a hit on each scene change. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

Tell me the concept and show a beat-by-beat storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.

## launch-film-one-take-glass
- Source: prompt-motion.com (creator: see Credits at the top; exact entry to be matched)
- Added: 2026-10-14

```text
<inputs>
Ask me for: a one-word brand name for the wordmark (a verb works best), 9 to 12 high-res photos, a royalty-free song around 120 BPM with a drop and a quiet breakdown (Mixkit, free for commercial use), and a free stock clip of a plain wall with moving plant shadows (Pexels).
</inputs>

<direction>
An Apple-keynote launch film, 2D only, one continuous take. Every scene is made out of the previous one: nothing fades, blurs or cuts. Objects change shape instead: text rises out of a mask line, icons pop from zero on a spring, bars draw across, pages push, and a black shape floods the whole frame and contracts into the next scene. Warm off-white canvas, black UI, iOS 26 liquid glass over the photos. Archivo (wdth 125, weight 800) for the wordmark, Geist for UI. A cursor drives every change with real clicks, drags and long-presses. The camera zooms screen-studio style so each moment fills the square, and the cursor scales with it.
Banned: crossfades, blur-ins, brightness "developing", 3D flips, particles, glows, holds longer than 1s, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM, 54 beats, something happens on every beat.
Open: the wordmark squeezes into its own period like an accordion, the dot grows into a black pill, a label rises inside it. Click: six iris blades close over the label and snap open onto a photo. The circle becomes a square, shrinks, the grid unfolds from behind it like a paper map (center, plus, corners), reflows into a bento, and a click zooms into one tile, landing exactly on the drop.
Glass: a glass word pops in letter by letter, melts into a droplet that stretches into a glass toolbar. The adjust icon turns it into a slider. Dragging relights the photo from day to golden hour (two aligned shots), and the knob turns into a glass lens while held. It lifts into a glass orb, the next photo opens inside it as a circle, and the orb expands into a lock screen: glass clock digits, date, and a home bar that stretches into a glass music player.
Stage: the lock screen pulls back into a phone (the bezel grows out of the screen edge). The Dynamic Island stretches like liquid, pinches off, flies over and grows into a Mac window that rolls up like a blind. Long-press the wallpaper, drag it onto a Safari tab, the page pushes in, drop it and it becomes the hero of a landing page. Scroll: the hero morphs into a framed print on a product card, with the mat and molding growing out of the photo's edge. Pick a frame color (it paints across) and a size, then the nav button flies down into "Order print".
Order: one black shape keeps morphing: Ordered ✓ → Printing % → On its way (a van on a route) → Delivered ✓.
Wall: the delivered circle floods the frame edge to edge, holds black for a beat, and contracts into the framed print hanging on the real wall footage. The same iris opens onto the print, closes again, the frame floods the screen and contracts into the pill → the dot → the letters spring back out, landing on the beat return. Last frame = first frame.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file, square 1440x1440. Every style is computed from time inside an async seek(t): no CSS transitions, no timers, no state between frames.
2. Springs are closed-form step responses. A value with many targets is the sum of one spring per change, so it stays a pure function of time.
3. Liquid glass: each glass element holds its own clone of the scene behind it, filtered with an SVG feImage displacement map (a rounded-rect distance field) through three feDisplacementMaps at slightly different scales for chromatic edges, plus a rim light. Glass letters: a canvas distance field per glyph gives the map, mask and highlights.
4. Goo: blur + alpha threshold, then composite the source atop it so the glass stays sharp inside.
5. Iris: 6 blades around a hexagonal aperture. Each blade is its two vertices, both edge extensions and the SHORT arc between them.
6. Wordmark squeeze: every letter moves toward the dot by the same factor and its drawn width follows (narrow the wdth axis, scale the rest), so the letters stay touching.
7. Footage: re-encode all-intra (ffmpeg -g 1), load it as a blob URL, await 'seeked' before drawing each frame.
8. Sound: a downloaded SFX for every event (Mixkit), never synthesized, each placed by its measured peak. The song starts on a downbeat: the zoom lands on the drop, the wall sits in the breakdown, the wordmark returns with the beat. Loudnorm to -14 LUFS.
9. Render with Playwright: 4 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix, 60fps. Check one frame per beat, then scan for single-frame pops (frame-difference spikes 3x their neighbours).
</build>

<gotchas>
backdrop-filter: url() misreads displacement maps in Chromium, so clone the scene instead. A flood must overscale past the corners and take about 0.3s, or half the screen changes in one frame. A child with visibility: visible shows through a hidden parent, so use inherit. Text that swaps inside a morphing shape needs its own mask. python http.server can't range-seek video, so use the blob URL.
</gotchas>

<start>
Ask me for the inputs, then show me the beat map and 4 stills (open, glass, stage, wall) before you write the full film.
</start>

## product-sting-frame-exact
- Source: prompt-motion.com (creator: see Credits at the top; exact entry to be matched)
- Added: 2026-10-14

```text
<inputs>
Ask me for: my product name, a logo (or let you draw a simple mark), the one-line thing a user types into the prompt box, the page that answers it (title + 2–3 sentences with one key phrase), two feature names for the stacked cards, and a music track. If I skip any, use the defaults: product "Frame by Frame" living inside its Whop hub, a viewfinder mark (four corner brackets around a bold "FF"), prompt "Make a launch video for my app", a lesson page titled "2.1 Choose a reference", cards "Launch" and "Sound", and Mixkit's free house track "Rising Forest" slowed to 124 BPM.
</inputs>

<direction>
A 12 second square product sting, 1080x1080, frame numbers at 29.97 fps (f0–f359), master rendered at 59.94 fps. Apple-keynote feel: soft, white, bright blue, glassy. The camera never cuts on a still frame: every shot enters already moving (exponential ease-out, 12–19% of the remaining distance per frame) and leaves on an accelerating move or a blur ramp. Blur follows speed and direction on every move.
Palette: page #FDFDFB, haze #B7CFEB, ice #E6F0FA, deep blue #294376 → #769CC2 sky gradient, navy #1E2F52, accent blues #2F6BFF / #3CC8F0 / mint #4ED6A0, white. Type: Inter (400/500/600/700). No purple, violet, magenta or orange anywhere.
Story: the product header rises out of a blue haze inside a light app window → a cursor glides in, turns to face where it's going, grows on hover and clicks the logo → hard cut on the music drop to the app icon with four squares orbiting into a cross → the icon collapses into a Mac menu bar → the cursor clicks the menu-bar icon, a frosted glass prompt box springs out and the prompt types → whip-tilt up through a light-blue flash into the answer page scrolling into place → a card rises over it → blur-dissolve to two stacked cards with giant frosted-glass titles → blur-dissolve to the lone logo disc → hard cut to a black end card with a glowing wordmark.
Banned: crossfades, frozen frames (except one hold in S7), stock UI kits, glows on UI text, Math.random, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
Coordinates are px on the 1080 stage. Music beat k = 0.048 + 0.4838·k s (124 BPM, one beat = 14.5 frames). The three hard cuts f72, f101, f159 land 2 frames before a beat: keep these exact frames.
S1 f0–71, header + window + click: haze #B7CFEB fading to #FDFDFB by f28, keep a blue floor glow #DBEEFD at the bottom. Header on one line: logo disc ⌀132 (#FBFCFE, 1px rim #E8E8EA, dark mark), the product name (Inter 500), a dark capsule pill "on Whop" (#2F2E2F, white text); the whole lockup spans x474–1063, centre line rises y932 (f0) → 776 (f2) → 683 (f5) → 608 (f10) → 546 (f24) → 536 (f37), drifting 1 px/frame after. Name appears f2 blurred, pill f4–5 heavily blurred and sliding 15 px left as it sharpens. A light hub window (radius 93, fill #FCFDFF, top band #F1F6FF, blue inner floor glow) fades in around it: opacity 0 to f14, 0.53 f15, 0.7 f19, 1.0 f24; top-left corner (408,405), runs off the right and bottom. Inside: a search pill in the top band, a left icon column (Courses icon at (537,739), faded Chat icon at (537,900)), and a course card from (764,700) off-frame with its cover image, title and "Course · 8 lessons". Cursor (black macOS arrow, white outline, 32x39) appears f27 at (891,393), glides left decelerating to (770,383) f44, rotates to point down-left f47–51 as it dives, lands on the disc's lower right (629,564) f56 → (587,546) f59 → (555,531) f71; grows ×1.55 on hover from f56; a soft ice ring (#D5F3FF → #F7FEFF, outer ⌀174) lights around the disc from f53. Camera zooms about (540,540): 1.0 f46 → 1.2 f60 ease-in-out, holds f61, then eases out accelerating to 1.04 at f71 while the cursor presses (shrinks 15% f69–71).
S2 f72–100, icon + orbit: navy squircle app icon (#294376 → #1E2F52, white mark), 276 px at f72 shrinking ease-out to 178 px by f86, radius 28% of width, on a grey halo disc #E9E9E7 growing ⌀240 (f75) → 326 (f86). Four 92 px squares (radius 26) spin in counter-clockwise, decelerating, and lock into a cross at orbit radius ≈216 by f86: white (1px #E3E8EF edge + faint shadow) left, #2F6BFF top, #3CC8F0 right, #4ED6A0 bottom. f88–100: the icon shrinks accelerating to ≈40 px, the squares slide into a row on its right (white slips behind the icon), blur ramps 0.3 → 6 px.
S3 f101–158, menu bar + prompt: white page above a black laptop bezel band (y425–475, top highlight #686866), a dark navy menu bar (y477–538), wallpaper below = the blue sky gradient with thin white line art (one big circle, two horizontal lines, one vertical, a four-point sparkle at a crossing, soft teal glow top-right). Menu bar right cluster in white: Wi-Fi, battery, toggles, the product mark at x531–584, three ⌀36 dots #2F6BFF / #3CC8F0 / #4ED6A0 at x612, 661, 709, "Mon Jun 22  9:41 AM" 34 px. Enters blurred 3 px and settling by f110. Cursor rises from below (f102), sits on the mark, presses f113–117. Camera pans content right +125 px f115–130 (fastest f118–120). A frosted glass box (white-blue glass over the sky, bright top rim, radius 60) springs out from under the mark f116: width peaks 744 at f126 and settles 726x228 by f138 around x196–922, y568–797. The prompt types from f121 (first legible "Make ") to f150 (complete) at about 1 char/frame with a 1-frame hold every 2–3 chars; caret always on; three white outline icons along the bottom; send button #2F6BFF ⌀51 with a white up arrow. From f136 the whole scene drifts up, accelerating into a whip-tilt (f158 moving ≈25 px/frame, vertical blur ≈6–8 px) while the page tints #E6F4FE over f154–158.
S4 f159–186, answer page: a light course lesson page (breadcrumb, title, body): text column x120, body 47 px Inter 400 grey #BCBCBA, line pitch 58, one key phrase ("frame for frame") in black 600. It arrives smeared and 420 px low, scrolls up with offsets 420, 315, 210, 170, 140, 116, 96, 81 (f166) … 14 (f175) … 0 (f180), then creeps −6 px by f186. Blur 24 px (f159) → 1.5 (f165) → 0. Flash #E2F4FE fading to #FDFDFB by f165. A cursor pointing straight up rides the scroll and stops under the key phrase (≈(450,591) f180), then drifts right.
S5 f187–214, card: a white card (x203–878, runs off the bottom) rises over the page: cover image 627x536 inset 24 px, radius 64, a light grabber bar at its top centre, caption semibold 38 px black, sub-caption grey 23 px. Cover top y642 (f187) → 456 (f191) → 395 (f196) → 369 (f200) → 348 (f205), then keeps drifting up ~4 px/frame. Card blur peaks 3.8 px at f189, sharp by f201; the page behind blurs to ≈2.5 px. Exit f207–214: card shrinks ~5% and rises while the whole frame blurs 1 → 7 px; cut at the blur peak.
S6 f215–244, two cards: white page, two stacked cards 538x348 (radius 57, gap 36) centred on x540, top card settling at y168 by f230, bottom at y552. Each: cover art (no text baked into it), a frosted pill top-left ("Module 3" / "Module 5"), a frosted round "•••" top-right, and a huge bold title along the bottom edge made of frosted glass (a blurred, lightened copy of the image clipped to the letters, cut off by the card's bottom edge): "Launch" and "Sound". Both enter blurred 12 px and sharp by f224; the top card enters 8% large and rises from y264; the bottom card rises from y927, staggered behind it. They drift up 3 px/frame f230–238, then accelerate up and blur out into the cut.
S7 f245–300, logo disc: page #FDFDFB, disc ⌀168 #F6F6F6 with the dark mark, rises into the centre (top y569 f245 → 491 f250 → 468 f255 → 456 f269) with a vertical smear on the cut frame, holds still f269–287 (the only frozen stretch), then shrinks accelerating to ⌀123 at f300.
S8 f301–359, end card: black radial background (#020204 corners, ≈#272729 around the word), the wordmark in Inter 600, white #F3F3F5 with a tight glow plus a wide soft halo, centred (540,540). Word width: ≈1650 px f301 (horizontally smeared, zoom streaks) → 1350 f302 → 1110 f303 → 1049 f304 → 734 f309 → 678 f311 → 563 f320 → 516 f342 (≈1 px/frame shrink) → 492 f350, then collapses ease-in: 450 f355 → 267 f359 with blur rising to 3.5 px. The film ends mid-collapse.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML page, 1080x1080, drawn by seek(t) as a pure function of the frame number. No CSS transitions, no timers, no Math.random (seeded hashes only). Shots register as {f0, f1, render(localFrame)}.
2. Every value is continuous in the frame number (the 59.94 master renders half frames): animate with keyframe tables kf(frame, [[f, value], ...], ease) and per-frame lookup tables with linear interpolation. No Math.floor on motion.
3. Blur: CSS filter blur for round blur, SVG feGaussianBlur with separate x/y stdDeviation for directional smears. Zoom smear on the end card = 20–30 scaled, faded copies of the word. Frosted glass = a blurred, lightened copy of what's behind, clipped to the shape.
4. Cursor: one SVG macOS arrow (black fill, white outline, soft shadow) with rotation and scale, reused in S1, S3, S4.
5. Sound (no voice), exactly 12.075 s: music at 124 BPM, soft intro, the drop at 2.47 s (beat 5, the f72 cut leads it by 2 frames). Synthesized SFX: soft impact 0.10 s; whooshes peaking at the cuts 2.402, 3.370, 5.305, 10.043 s; transition hits exactly on 6.240 s and 8.175 s; clicks at 2.33 and 3.83 s; very quiet key ticks every ~32 ms over 4.04–5.00 s; a soft shimmer at 10.05 s. Master to −14 LUFS, true peak −1 dBTP, no fade except the last 60 ms.
6. Render with Playwright (one screenshot per frame, fonts loaded first), encode H.264 yuv420p at 60000/1001, mux the audio.
</build>

<gotchas>
Measure text only after the fonts load. A long product name won't fit where a 5-letter name did: scale the whole lockup (disc gap, name, pill) to fit the span x474–1063, don't let the pill fall off-frame. A white orbit square vanishes on the white page without a 1px edge and a faint shadow. Don't put images with their own text inside the S6 cards, or the glass title doubles up. Keep the cut frames exact even where they don't sit on a beat. Nothing freezes except S7 f269–287. Heavy blur tables can wipe a shape out completely: if a frame looks empty, lower the blur until the shape still reads.

## product-showreel-throughline (variant: 30 s + reference video)
- Source: prompt-motion.com (creator: see Credits at the top; exact entry to be matched)
- Added: 2026-10-14
- Differs from the base block: 30 s instead of 15 s; takes its visual style from a reference video the user supplies; "above all, it should be very cool".

```text
<inputs>
Ask me for anything below I haven't given you. If I skip it, use the default: 3 to 6 screenshots of the real interface (default: capture them yourself), the logo (default: take it from the site), brand colors and font (default: its own colors and typeface), and a royalty-free track with a clear beat (default: compose one in code).
</inputs>

<direction>
A 30-second showreel for Distilbook. Research it first: what it does, who it's for, its real interface and its brand. Use what you find; never invent screens, features or numbers.
Pick one through-line object from the product itself (its cursor, a key button, the logo's mark, a single data point) and make every scene a transformation of it: it starts in the UI, changes shape or role in each scene, and becomes the logo on the end card. Name it before you storyboard.
Rebuild the real UI as vector layers so its parts can move on their own; never slide a flat screenshot in. A cursor drives every interaction with real clicks and drags, and the camera zooms screen-studio style so each moment fills the frame.
Brand: its own colors and typeface. One typeface, one accent color used only on the through-line object and the key word, lots of empty space. Take the visual style from the reference video I give you (download it). Above all, it should be very cool.
Motion rules: springs with at most a small overshoot; nothing appears from nothing (it grows, unfolds or is revealed by a mask); the camera never sits still (push from 1.0 to 1.04 across a scene, and start each scene at the zoom the last one ended on); something changes on every beat.
Banned: particle bursts, glows, lens flares, camera shake, RGB split, crossfades, generic gradients, bouncy easing, holds longer than half a second, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
120 BPM. Write a timed storyboard first, beat by beat, then build exactly that.
Hook (first bar): the problem in three to five words, in big type that the through-line object interrupts.
Middle: three or four moments of the product doing what it does best. Each begins with the through-line object turning into the next UI element and lands one readable idea.
Payoff (last bars): the strongest moment on the biggest beat, then the through-line object becomes the logo and the end card: the name and a one-line call to action.
</structure>

<build>
1. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
2. Use spring and exponential easing written as functions of time. Blur follows speed and direction on fast moves.
3. Write a soundtrack in code with the Web Audio API (OfflineAudioContext): a kick on every beat and a hit on each scene change. Render it to WAV.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux the audio.
5. Before the full render, render one frame per beat and look at them. Fix anything cluttered, off the beat, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Measure element positions at runtime for match cuts instead of hard-coding them. When a shape fills the frame, scale it past all four corners. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap. Never put will-change on anything the camera scales, or text renders blurry.
</gotchas>

<start>
Show me what you found, the through-line object and a beat-by-beat storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.

- Added: 2026-10-14

```text
<direction>
A 3-minute explainer on what Git is, and what the most common commands mean for someone with zero computer background. Research it first and keep every fact right; never invent numbers or quotes.
Build the whole explanation as one diagram in one continuous space: the camera zooms into a part to explain it and pulls back to show how it fits, so the viewer always knows where they are. Every idea gets a picture before it gets words, and labels sit on the thing they name, never in a legend.
Style: simple diagrams of files, snapshots and branches that build as they're explained. Narrate it with a Mandarin Chinese voice (e.g. edge-tts zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural), with subtitles synced line by line. You can install any tools you need and search the web.
Motion rules: one thing moves at a time, and the eye always knows where to look; arrows and flows animate in the direction things actually move; no more than seven words on screen at once, held for at least 0.3 seconds a word.
Banned: walls of text, bullet lists, generic gradients, stock-looking icons, glows, crossfades, anything that looks like a template.
</direction>

<structure>
Write a timed storyboard first, then build exactly that.
Hook: a question the viewer already has, asked over the first picture.
Middle: three to five steps. Each zooms into one part of the diagram, shows one concrete example, then pulls back as that part locks into place.
Payoff: a final pull back to the whole diagram, now complete, and a one-line takeaway.
</structure>

<build>
1. Write the narration script first, line by line, marking what's on screen for each line.
2. Generate each line with a Mandarin Chinese voice (e.g. edge-tts zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural) and time the animation to each line's real audio length.
3. One HTML file at 1920x1080. Every style is computed from time inside window.seek(t): no CSS animations, no timers, no state carried between frames.
4. Render with Playwright at 60fps, 3 subframes per frame blended with ffmpeg tmix for motion blur, then mux in the narration, quiet music under it and subtitles.
5. Before the full render, export a key frame from each section and check it. Fix anything crowded, overlapping or hard to read.
</build>

<gotchas>
Check every number and name against a source. Keep the diagram's layout fixed so zooming in and out never reshuffles it. Give outgoing and incoming text separate timing so letters never overlap.

Show me the script, the diagram and a timed storyboard, then build it without asking me anything else. Give me the final MP4.
